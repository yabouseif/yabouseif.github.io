               <h3><i>Her,</i> and the fututre of artificial intelligence</h3>

    <p> There is a plethora of narrative structures in cinema. Although some films mimic reality, or the makers attempt to recreate it through visual means, others tell the story in a more abstract method. Inherently, the storyteller and subject matter influence the structure in which the story is visually told; different people, from all cultures, have distinctive stories to tell and therefore have different narratives. While focusing on the elements of narrative of Spike Jonze’s Her (2013), particularly diegetic sound and cinematography, it is apparent that several artistic choices originate from, or address, ethical concerns regarding our social structure and human-machine relationships, leaving the audience filled with more questions of our possible near-future.</p>

    <p> From watching the opening sequence alone, it is clear to the viewer that what is depicted is entirely from Theodore’s (played by Joaquin Phoenix) perspective unequivocally: the film starting with close-up shot of Theodore’s face as he dictates his client’s love letter, followed by the camera tracking Theodore through each scene as he goes home form work. Jonze portrayal of Theodore is quite sorrowful, based off of most of his requests to his operating system: “Play a melancholy song. Play a different melancholy song” This piece of dialogue calls attention to a current ethical concern: our dependency on technology. While the current topic is that of social media dependency, it is presumed that human interaction will become almost non-existent, and even more of a challenge for introverted personalities. Jonze makes that argument using Theodore, as how strongly disengaged he is from life leads to him to pursue a relationship with his AI. The depressed attitude evoked from the monotonous and computerized voice of his operating system is later emphasized when we are introduced to Samantha, the new OS, played by Scarlett Johansson, as the audience can then compare the two alternatives. Theodore’s job as a writer for Beautifully Handwritten Letters, indicates a future stripped of personalized authenticity, where man has evolved into a man-machine hybrid, and the thought and effort that goes into writing a handwritten letter have been simplified to empty gestures and cliches: “There was not a dry eye in the house including mine”… “We hope that you and your wife come visit us soon.” While Theodore comments on Samantha’s voice and its legitimacy: “You seem like a person” … “It’s just, you go, [breathes deeply] It’s not like you need oxygen”, Samantha describes it as “affectation” aggressively, further highlighting the extent of this artificial world that is strictly made to please. </p>

    <p> Another cinematic choice that Jonze uses to underline the false narrative of a happy and conventional future is the color palette, which can be viewed clearly thanks to a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BsqaOm8gkcH/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1blw02zv7yszt.">repost by Cinema Magic.</a> While yes, the color palette appears to be complimentary, it is far too surreal to be accepted. Some colors seem too vibrant and others too pastel for the context in which they exist, which of course is subjective depending on the viewer. However, the most obscure is the combination of a mute-toned room and attire, while still incorporating a pop of color in the distance — that is too unearthly. This surreal color palette provides an aesthetically pleasing arrangement of tones, but when the viewer is then forced to look deeper into the story: none of it is satisfactory. This contrast is used to further highlight the extent of artificiality in this world, beyond just a technological stand-point. Which begs the question: if technology shapes our world to please us, what does it take to please technology? What are their needs if we already know our own? Recalling Plaisance’s Media Ethics: Key Principles for Responsible Practice: “Technology, [in this case], is determining the makeup of our social lives. Rather than being harnessed to help promote values we embrace, technology comes to determine those values, and even promote other values as normal that we may have not seen as such before. Rather than serving our social and cultural priorities, the march of technology becomes an end in itself (p.57).” Which raises a more important question: as artificial intelligence learns and adapts, it further alters its priorities — will mankind then lose sight of their preconceived priorities? Should that be the case, or are we not evolving as quickly for our priorities to evolve? To answer that, one must be conscious of how quickly their evolving to begin with.</p>

    <p>A visual depiction of a depressed state of mind, accompanied by a apropos score, dialogue and color palette, and then a state in which happiness is quickly classified as insincere as it is crafted, viewers are given no choice but to view this possible happening in a negative sense given than those are the only options. Moreover, when you are not omnisciently analyzing a way of life it is easy to be oblivious to its faults, recalling Plaisance once more: “In our reliance on technology, it is easy to assume that every advance is a positive one. For that assumption it is not a big step to see the development of technology as an inexorable march of progress — a march that not only is unquestioned, but that we as individuals are powerless to stop or control.” (p.57) Whether or not Jonze intended to make this point, he certainly offered us a courtesy regardless: allowing us to analyze a possible flawed future so that we may possibly prevent it. </p>
    
    <p>A social concern that I noticed prior to even watching film, though aware of its context, was the title itself: Her. Given that the title is a gender pronoun, one could assume that the film has a feminine reach, however, given that the reference is of a female-voiced AI and the film is told entirely in Theodore’s perspective, the naming seems quite fallacious. Therefore, it appears that Jonze is asking us to question our own gender roles, especially as we get to know the layers of Theodore’s personality. While his character archetype is gentle and sensitive; a conventional adjective would be “feminine”, even though it seems non-germane. Paul (played by Chris Pratt), Theodore’s co-worker, compliments him by saying “[y]ou have a woman inside of you” after reading one of his letters: an odd compliment that could loosely be tied to Samantha’s influence. In Plaisance chapter on harm, he states that: “advertisers constantly rely on such rigid gender characterizations, critics argue that children internalize these roles and are not encouraged to explore roles — or even emotions — that are associated with the opposite gender. This they say, can be harmful psychologically” (p.136), which I think comes across in the character of Paul: categorizing sensitivity and femininity together. A prominent question that arose regarding the title is: whether or not artificial intelligence can be gender specified? And from that I also wonder: what is the extent of AI’s sexual fluidity? These questions first surfaced during the setup of the new OS: “Do you want your OS to have a male or female voice?” The OS system then names herself Samantha, a feminine name, after Theodore chooses the female voice. I wondered if this process is what defines the gender of the machine. Samantha later announces that she’s in love with 641 other “people”, which in this case applies to human beings and other OS systems. However she never specifies gender nor does she need to. By that point, the audience is aware of just how unprejudiced Samantha is as she is not boxed into predetermined social structures, therefore, it is safe to assume that gender isn’t a factor to consider in her artificial mind. During the set-up of Samantha, as she talks about her creators and begins to learn more about Theodore — about everything really — I was immediately reminded of Sophia, a humanoid robot developed by Hanson Robotics. Sophia is the first robot to be declared a citizen, by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia no less, and her first conversation with her creator, asking profound yet arbitrary questions so she can therefore learn, is practically a facsimile of Samantha and Theodore’s first conversation. Ironically, the film premiered 4 years before Sophia was announced. </p>

    <p> In conclusion, Jonze addresses several ethical concerns in regards to society, our  relationship with technology, and the possible future concerns regarding technologies’ likelihood to autonomize, in his film Her. The cinematic choices, even the rudimentary ones, made by Jonze prominently sparks questions regarding both our present and future, leaving the audience in  awe when the realization of this probable future looks unlike anything we have seen before in the history of society.</p>
