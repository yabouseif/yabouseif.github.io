               <h3><i>Clueless</i>, and the MTV Generation</h3>

    <p> While the craft of storytelling is universal, there are infinite methods to create a strong narrative through visual means; a selection between mimicking reality or through extremely abstract representations. With a satirical tone, Amy Heckerling tells the story of Cher Horowitz and her comfortable life in Los Angles, California. It is hard to overlook the elements of narrative, such as character depth, symbolism, sound, and the role that cinematography plays in Heckerling’s Clueless (1995), especially when their executed brilliantly in a three minute opening sequence.</p>
<p>During the opening credits, Cher’s morning routine accompanied by her own narration, the audience immediately learns that Cher is the protagonist and the entire movie is told from her point of view, undoubtedly. Given the light-hearted and comedic tone of the film, having been inspired by 90s television sitcoms, Cher’s narration follows what is visually depicted with ironic remarks that are sometimes even contradictive: “I actually have a way normal life for a teenage girl. I mean, I get up, brush my teeth and pick out my school clothes” followed by Cher deciding on what to wear with the help of a computer, as if it were a modern-day fairytale . Heckerling uses this element of non-diegetic sound is to ensure that the audience is viewing the film from her perspective – a clueless one. A computer deciding on what is suitable attire simply cannot be accepted as the norm and not to mention it is ahead of the film’s time. This obnoxiously points out the narrator's economic status as well as her inability to handle basic tasks like figuring out an outfit that matches; after her first choice was declared a ‘mis-match’… by a Macintosh. We are later presented by a series of aerial view shots, medium shots and long shots as Cher drives recklessly in her Jeep to the sound of No Doubt’s “Just A Girl”. The exciting cinematographic choices, combined with the imagery of crashing into potted plants while listening to trendy music taken from pop culture resembles the exciting montage shown earlier in the opening, which captivates the audience once more. As she narrates, Cher casually states that she is driving without a license, showing the extent of her ignorance, however it is not taken seriously by the audience nor by other characters: “I didn’t even know you could get a ticket without a license” her father states later in the film . Heckerling uses this to notify to the audience to not take these events too seriously because even the parents do not. After seeing Dion’s luxurious home, Cher informs the audience that they are friend because they “both know what it’s like to have people jealous” of them, which implies that all they have in common is wealth  . Cher’s narration throughout the opening sequence is what makes each transition subtle and seamless. More importantly, without this non-diegetic element the film loses its light-hearted and witty idiosyncrasy, crucial in setting the tone, as Heckerling ridicules the MTV generation and their obsession with materialistic things. </p>
<p>
The opening sequence also presents strong character depth, depicting the layers of Cher’s character and suggesting that she is not as ‘clueless’ as we thought. It seems that even though Cher is oblivious to real life problems, she is very keen on getting her way, and that is apparent throughout the entirety of the film. Her scheming tendencies and high status on the social food chain is foreshadowed when speaking to her father. As we first see Cher’s father we are being told by the narrator that he is a litigator and that Lucy the maid is “terrified of him”, indicating that he is serious and will clash with Cher’s character. The high angle shot of the father descending the staircase as Lucy runs and quivers, indicates a clear power dynamic; a stereotypical one where the man of the house is in charge. Comically, Heckerling squashes that idea quickly once he is on the ground floor and level with Cher in the kitchen, belittling his profession: “He fights with me for free because I’m his daughter” . While listening to the dialogue, we see a recognizable battle for power as both Cher and her father are throwing demands at each other, while impotent Lucy hides behind the kitchen door. The conversation between Cher and her father, as well as the character grouping within the house, foreshadows Cher’s mischievous behavior and her ability to mask it with her cute and gullible wit. That way, the audience can anticipate further manipulation from her end – she seems to already have control over the house, why be surprised when she immorally receives good grades “based on the powers of persuasion”. </p>
<p>
Furthermore, Heckerling efficiently creates a strong and clear narrative in the opening credits, depicting a clear point of view with remarks to the protagonist’s materialism, disobedience and struggles that will later be expanded on. She does so early on as it aids the audience’s realization to Cher’s sudden change from privileged and incompetent to hardworking and determined, while still somewhat clueless.</p>
